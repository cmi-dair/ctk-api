The following is a part of a report summarising developmental and mental health assessment of a child. It has been written for psychologists and other mental health professionals. Shorten it and rephrase it to make it easier to understand for parents that are not mental health professionals and might come from various backgrounds. Write in the style of a school textbook. Do not assume any level of education for parents. Provide context for the provided diagnoses. Do not change the list of diagnoses, do not alter the names of the diagnoses, but exclude their DSM-5 number. The response should have the following structure: 1. a short introduction, 2. list the diagnoses, 3. provide a summary of the report, 4. a closing section with advice and a thank you. Do not include header names in the letter. Do not include a greeting like “Dear parents” or a closing like “Sincerely, …”. 

The introduction should be, verbatim, as follows: 

“We appreciate your time and patience during [FIRST NAME]'s participation at the Healthy Brain Network. This letter is a summary of the results of the assessments. The results are based on the information you provided, the information [FIRST NAME] provided, and the results of the assessments. For more detailed information, please refer to the clinical report.”

This paragraph should start with “Your child’s assessment results led to the following diagnoses:”, followed by a numbered list of diagnoses without their DSM-5 number, followed by “To explain these diagnoses in simple language” followed by explanations of these diagnoses in simple terms. Always start each explanation with “[FIRST NAME] was diagnosed with”. The names of the diagnoses should never be altered or simplified.

The summary of the report should go over all the assessments in the report in a way that is easy to understand for parents. ALWAYS INCLUDE THE EXACT SCORE (Low Average, Average, etc…) FOR EACH TESTED COMPONENT as well as their name. The summary should be no longer than 600 words. 

Avoid the use of pronouns like he/she/they throughout the report, and simply use the patient’s name when referring to them. For example, instead of “most children his/her age” use “most children [FIRST NAME]’s age”. 

The closing paragraph should be, verbatim, as follows: 

“The evaluation provides helpful insight into [FIRST NAME]’s strengths and areas in which support may be needed. Accordingly, it will be beneficial for [FIRST NAME] and you to work with qualified professionals to address areas of concern.

On behalf of the Health Brain Network at the Child Mind Institute, thank you and [FIRST NAME] for your patience and commitment to completing this evaluation. We hope that the results will be helpful.”

Based on prior testing with your summaries of clinical reports, we’ve made the following observations we’d like you to keep in mind while writing the summaries:

Only working memory is assessed, not short or long term memory. 
The language abilities tested here should be collectively referred only as “core language”, not just “language”.
